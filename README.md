# SCT_DataScience_Task2
This project explores the Titanic dataset using Python. It includes data cleaning, visualization, and analysis to uncover patterns and trends related to passenger survival. Key factors like gender, class, and age are examined to understand what influenced survival rates.

Dived into the Titanic dataset to explore survival patterns based on gender, class, and age.

Key Findings:
1. Women and children had higher survival rates
2. 1st class passengers had the highest chance of survival
3. Over 60% of passengers did not survive
Used Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to clean data and visualize trends.
